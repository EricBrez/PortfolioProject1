The artifact is an application that can hold animals that are being trained as rescue animals, contradictory to what my code review stated (showcasing the importance of documentation) that I created in the second computer science class that I took (IT-145 introduction to application development). I chose to include it in my portfolio because I wanted to show how I have progressed since I started as I had no coding experience before coming to SNHU. The plans for my enhancements also changed, I was not able to create a gui or a database for this milestone. I did however port the entire project to C++ and improve the structure of the application, reducing a significant amount of redundant code and highlighting my ability to keep up with multiple decision branches at a time. I also did a little bit of changes to how the program displayed, mainly by reorganizing the menu options that display to have a better flow. Given the inclusions of the next two enhancements I am still on track to accomplish all of the course outcomes that I planned to as my original plan had all three categories in this one program, reducing the enhancements to what I did does not change progress at this point. The biggest challenges I faced while performing this enhancement were structuring the .h and .cpp files to fit together correctly, at one point I had almost 400 errors lined up because of a namespace issue with the .h files. I remember in one of my previous classes that it is not advised to use the overarching std namespace for .h files so once I figured out that that was the problem that was causing those errors I went through and made sure that I removed the using namespaces std; line and deliberately put std:: everywhere appropriate in those files. Once that was done the rest flowed smoothly.
